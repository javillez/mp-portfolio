            <h3>Transcript</h3>
            <p>Kieran: Hi I’m Kieran O’Connor and I’m here today with David O’Connor and he’s gonna tell us about an incident that changed his day to day life. So first question is, what day did the incident occur on?</p>
<p>David: Times past now it was back in September of 2013 one Saturday, early afternoon.</p>
<p>Kieran: Whereabouts were you headed that afternoon?</p>
<p>David: I had just been returning back from a junior football team with the expectation of taking the misses into Manchester with our friends.</p>
<p>Kieran: How did the altercation begin?</p>
<p>David: We were in traffic sat in my car just driving on, when a vehicle tried to get out in between some parked cars, so I just stopped, naturally, let the car get out and just as I was sitting back off I looked in my rear view mirror there was a guy who was growing increasingly frustrated with me, so I thought ill get out of the car have a word with him, find out what his problem is and explain what I was doing.</p>
<p>Kieran: Did you have any idea the incident would become so serious in them first moments?</p>
<p>David: No not at all, Id just be going out having a chat with him, saying I had no other option but to stop, this guy had come out in front of me and was halfway out, so as I walked over to the guy behind, he pulled out sped past so I get back in the car, and the next minute when I looked up he parked on an angle in front of the car, and had commenced booting the front of the car. I'll see what his problem is and try to stop him from kicking the front of the car. At which point, as I was getting out of the door he came and booted the door shut and got my hand clear and took the top of my thumb straight off.</p>
<p>Kieran: Did you recognize that your thumb had come off straight away?</p>
<p>David: No just cause I was in the heat of the moment with this guy, I must have had some type of sensation I don’t know really cant really remember that clearly now.</p>
<p>Kieran: So obviously only having half a thumb now, is there any day to day tasks that you’ve struggled with since?</p>
<p>David: Yeah, getting your hand in a packet, cause there’s a sensation that the end of your thumb is still there so you’re sort of grabbing for things, but obviously its not and so your brain quickly adapts.</p>
<p>Kieran: Well uh thanks for talking with us today David its been a pleasure talking to you.</p>
<p>David: Thank you.</p>
