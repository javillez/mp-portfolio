            <h3>Transcript</h3>
            <p>João: I’m João, and I’m here with Nicole May, one of the founding members of Young Identity a group of poets and spoken word artists who are dominating the Manchester art scene. So Nicole could you expand on what Young Identity is? </p>
<p>Nicole: Young Identity is a charity which is based in Manchester, and we work across Greater Manchester nationally and also internationally, we are a spoken word organization that develops young peoples voice but also different pathways into the arts. </p>
<p>João: We understand that you also founded And What TV, could you expand on what that is? </p>
<p>Nicole: So And What TV is an online spoken word channel that I set up, its capturing the Northern voice, but when I started travelling I went around the world recording different poets because I felt like everything was either London or American. I’m from Manchester, born and bred Manchester, so I thought it would be great to capture some Northern voices in there too. </p>
<p>João: So in just a couple of words, could you tell us what you think makes Young Identity so special and different from other charities of other kind? </p>
<p>Nicole: The lead, so if you’re interested in filmmaking interested in teaching, interested in putting on events we allow young people to have that opportunity and have not tokenistic leadership but real leadership, we go here’s a budget lets go for it, or if you have any other problems at home whether somethings going on, we support young people through that, so our pastoral care is heart and is key towards what we do at Young Identity. They’ve had Tv advertisements for nationwide, we’ve worked in schools so we actually go do you know what, we believe in your voice and we pay them and we believe it, and its good because at the end of the day you know everyone needs to eat. </p>
<p>João: Ok thank you Nicole, and finally do you have any insight on what’s next for Young Identity that you could tell us about? </p>
<p>Nicole: Yeah so what’s next is we have a book launch so the young people have wrote a book responding to the themes of an exhibitions or the different exhibitions and films at the venue Home, and the book launch is on the 21st of January 2020. </p>
<p>João: Ok well thank you very much for being here Nicole I’m glad you could join us well be sure to check out the book when it comes out. This has been an interview with Nicole May thank you for joining us. </p>
